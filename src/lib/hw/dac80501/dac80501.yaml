            desc: REF_ALARM bit. Reads 1 when the difference between the reference and supply pins is below a minimum analog threshold. Reads 0 otherwise. When 1, the reference buffer is shut down, and the DAC outputs are all zero volts. The DAC codes are unaffected, and the DAC output returns to normal when the difference is above the analog threshold.
